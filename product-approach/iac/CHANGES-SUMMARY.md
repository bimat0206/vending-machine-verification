# API Gateway Base Path Changes Summary

## Overview
The API Gateway module has been updated to simplify the base path structure. Previously, the API used `/api/v1` as its base path, which resulted in redundant path segments in the final invoke URL. The base path has been changed to `/api/` to create a cleaner URL structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Resource Structure
- Removed the `/api/v1` path segment in favor of `/api/`
- Updated all child resources to be direct children of the `/api/` resource
- Modified all endpoint paths in the Terraform configuration

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with the new endpoint paths
- Added a new section explaining the API base path structure
- Added CHANGELOG.md files to all modules to track changes

### 3. File Changes
The following files were modified:
- `resources.tf`: Updated resource definitions and path comments
- `methods.tf`: Updated method comments to reflect new paths
- `cors_integration_responses.tf`: Updated integration response comments
- `README.md`: Updated documentation with new paths and added explanations

## Benefits
- Simplified URL structure: `https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}/api/...`
- Eliminated redundant path segments
- Improved clarity in API documentation
- Better alignment with API versioning best practices (version in stage name)

## Testing Recommendations
After deploying these changes, verify that:
1. All API endpoints are accessible at their new paths
2. Any client applications are updated to use the new paths
3. Documentation is consistent with the implemented changes
