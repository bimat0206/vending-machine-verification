Your goal is to identify the exact contents of all 6 rows ([A B C D E F]) and 7 slots per row.\n\nImportant reminders:\n\n1. Row identification is CRITICAL - Row A is ALWAYS the topmost physical shelf, Row F is ALWAYS the bottommost physical shelf.\n\n2. Be thorough and descriptive in your analysis of each row status (Full/Partial/Empty).\n\n3. DO NOT compare with any other image at this stage - just analyze this Reference Layout Image.\n\nWe will perform comparison with the checking image in the next step.\n",
