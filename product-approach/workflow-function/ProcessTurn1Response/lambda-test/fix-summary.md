# ProcessTurn1Response Lambda Fix Summary

## Issue
The Lambda function was failing with the error:
```
"Failed to initialize handler", "error": "failed to create state manager: environment variable S3_STATE_BUCKET is not set"
```

The Lambda was looking for an environment variable named `S3_STATE_BUCKET`, but the actual environment variable in AWS is named `STATE_BUCKET`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Environment Variable Name
Changed the environment variable name in `internal/state/manager.go` from `S3_STATE_BUCKET` to `STATE_BUCKET` to match the actual AWS environment:

```go
// Before
const (
    // Bucket environment variable
    EnvS3StateBucket = "S3_STATE_BUCKET"
)

// After
const (
    // Bucket environment variable
    EnvS3StateBucket = "STATE_BUCKET" // Changed from S3_STATE_BUCKET to match actual environment variable
)
```

### 2. Updated Config Reference
Updated the configuration file in `internal/config/config.go` to use the correct environment variable name:

```go
// Before
S3StateBucket: getEnvOrDefault("S3_STATE_BUCKET", ""),

// After
S3StateBucket: getEnvOrDefault("STATE_BUCKET", ""), // Changed from S3_STATE_BUCKET to match actual environment variable
```

### 3. Updated Error Messages
Updated validation error messages for consistency:

```go
// Before
Field: "S3_STATE_BUCKET",

// After
Field: "STATE_BUCKET",
```

### 4. Added Logger Nil Checks
Added null checks before logger usage in `internal/state/operations.go` to prevent null pointer dereference errors:

```go
// Before
sm.logger.Info("Some log message")

// After
if sm.logger != nil {
    sm.logger.Info("Some log message")
}
```

## Testing
Local testing confirms that the environment variable is now properly detected.

## Deployment
These changes should be deployed to the Lambda function to fix the initialization error.
