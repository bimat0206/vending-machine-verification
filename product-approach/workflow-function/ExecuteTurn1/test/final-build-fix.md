# ExecuteTurn1 Final Build Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Docker Build Path Error**
   - Modified Dockerfile build command to use `./cmd/main.go` instead of `cmd/main.go`
   - The original path was not correctly recognized in the Docker build context

2. **Missing Go Source File**
   - Renamed `cmd/main.md` to `cmd/main.go`
   - The file had an incorrect extension which prevented Go from recognizing it as a source file

## Changes Made

1. In `Dockerfile`:
   ```diff
   - RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o /main cmd/main.go
   + RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o /main ./cmd/main.go
   ```

2. File renaming:
   ```bash
   mv cmd/main.md cmd/main.go
   ```

3. Local build verification:
   ```bash
   CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o test-build ./cmd/main.go
   ```

## Build Status

âœ… **Fixed**: The build now completes successfully, both locally and in Docker.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t execute-turn1 .
   ```

2. **Tag and push to ECR:**
   ```bash
   docker tag execute-turn1:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/execute-turn1:latest
   docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/execute-turn1:latest
   ```

## Version Information

These changes have been documented in the CHANGELOG.md:
- Version 1.0.3: Fixed Docker build issue with path
- Version 1.0.4: Fixed missing main.go file (renamed from main.md)

## Recommendations

1. **File Extensions**: Ensure all Go source files use the `.go` extension
2. **Path References**: Use relative paths (`./cmd/main.go`) instead of absolute paths (`cmd/main.go`) in build commands
3. **Build Verification**: Always test builds locally before Docker builds
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Consider adding a CI/CD check to verify file extensions
