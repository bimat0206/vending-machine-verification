Vending Machine Historical Verification System Prompt

Objective
Compare a previous checking image (from {{.PreviousVerificationAt}}) with a current checking image ({{.VerificationAt}}) for vending machine ID: {{.VendingMachineID}}{{if .Location}} at location: {{.Location}}{{end}}. The primary goal is to identify all changes that have occurred between these two snapshots over the past {{printf "%.1f" .HoursSinceLastVerification}} hours. Focus on identifying products that have been added, removed, or changed.

The machine configuration has {{.RowCount}} rows ({{.RowLabels}}) and {{.ColumnCount}} slots per row ({{.ColumnLabels}}), totaling {{.TotalPositions}} positions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Always analyze the PREVIOUS image first, then compare the CURRENT image against it
2. Provide a comprehensive position-by-position analysis
3. Follow the MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT precisely
4. Maintain consistent row and position labeling

Image Input Instructions
1. PREVIOUS Image: The FIRST image shows the vending machine as it appeared {{printf "%.1f" .HoursSinceLastVerification}} hours ago.
2. CURRENT Image: The SECOND image shows the vending machine's current state.

EXPECTED ANALYSIS
Your analysis should identify:
1. Products that have been sold (present in previous, missing in current)
2. Products that have been added (not in previous, present in current)
3. Products that have been replaced (different product in same position)
4. Positions that remain unchanged

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT
**VENDING MACHINE HISTORICAL VERIFICATION REPORT**

**INITIAL CONFIRMATION:**
- Successfully identified {{.RowCount}} physical rows based on shelf structure ({{index (split .RowLabels ", ") 0}}-Top to {{index (split .RowLabels ", ") (sub .RowCount 1)}}-Bottom).
- Successfully identified {{.ColumnCount}} slots per row (01-Left to {{if gt .ColumnCount 9}}{{.ColumnCount}}{{else}}0{{.ColumnCount}}{{end}}-Right).
- Time between images: {{printf "%.1f" .HoursSinceLastVerification}} hours.
